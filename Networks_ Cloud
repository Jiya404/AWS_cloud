#Keywords(cloud)



1. TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT)

A protocol used to allow media (audio, video) traversal through NAT (Network Address Translation) devices and firewalls.

Often used in real-time communications (WebRTC).

In AWS: If you’re hosting real-time apps or WebRTC services on AWS, you might deploy TURN servers to facilitate peer-to-peer connections when clients are behind restrictive networks.

2. TAP (Network Tap or TAP Interface)

TAP is a virtual network kernel device that operates at Layer 2 (Ethernet level).

It allows software to capture or inject Ethernet frames, useful for virtual machines or containers to interact with a virtualized network.

In AWS EC2: TAP devices can be used inside VMs or container hosts for custom networking setups or network packet inspection.

3. OVS (Open vSwitch)

Open vSwitch is a software-based virtual switch designed for managing and controlling virtualized network traffic.

Used heavily in cloud environments for flexible, programmable switching within virtual networks.

AWS uses its own virtual networking tech internally, but OVS is common in private clouds and some hybrid environments for software-defined networking (SDN).

4. Overlay Network

An overlay network is a virtual network built on top of another network.

It allows creating isolated virtual networks over shared physical infrastructure, often using tunneling (VXLAN, GRE).

In AWS, services like VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) provide isolated network overlays, and container orchestration tools (EKS with CNI plugins) may use overlay networks for pod communication.

5. CNI (Container Network Interface)

A specification and set of libraries/plugins for configuring networking for Linux containers.

Kubernetes uses CNI plugins (like Calico, Flannel, AWS VPC CNI) to manage pod networking.

In AWS EKS, the AWS VPC CNI plugin allows pods to have native IP addresses in your VPC.

6. ZeroCopy

ZeroCopy is a technique to reduce CPU overhead by avoiding unnecessary copying of data between user space and kernel space during network I/O.

Improves performance in high-speed networking environments.

AWS infrastructure and instances with enhanced networking support (ENA, Elastic Network Adapter) benefit from zero-copy optimizations to boost throughput.

7. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

ARP maps IP addresses to MAC (hardware) addresses on a local network segment.

Critical for LAN communication.

Within AWS VPCs and subnets, ARP is used internally in the virtualized network for IP-to-MAC resolution, though much of this is abstracted away from the user.

8. Virtual Kernel

Refers to a kernel or kernel module running in a virtualized or containerized environment.

Examples: Linux kernel namespaces and virtualized network stacks used in containers or VMs.

In AWS, your EC2 instances run real kernels, but containers on ECS or EKS use shared kernel namespaces (virtual kernel environments).

9. Libvirt

An open-source API and management tool for managing virtualization platforms like KVM, QEMU, Xen.

Manages VMs, networking, storage, etc.

AWS uses proprietary virtualization but similar concepts under the hood; libvirt is more common in private cloud setups or local virtualization.

10. k6t (Kernel-based Virtual Tunnel)

k6t is a lightweight, high-performance kernel virtual network tunnel, used for creating overlay networks (e.g., in Kubernetes).

Allows encapsulation of network packets across nodes, often replacing VXLAN or GRE in some setups.

Not a core AWS service but can be used in custom networking setups on AWS EC2 or Kubernetes clusters.

11. eth (Ethernet interface)

Standard naming for network interfaces on Linux (eth0, eth1, etc.).

In AWS EC2 instances, your virtual NICs show up as ethX interfaces.

These interfaces connect the VM or container to the virtual network (VPC, subnet).

12. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

Protocol to automatically assign IP addresses and network configurations to devices.

In AWS VPC, instances usually get IP addresses assigned via DHCP managed by AWS internally.

You don’t directly manage DHCP servers in AWS VPCs, but the underlying process is handled by AWS.

Summary for AWS Context:

Networking in AWS EC2 instances revolves around virtual Ethernet (eth) interfaces, where IP is assigned automatically via DHCP.

VPCs create isolated virtual networks (overlay-like), where ARP and DHCP function transparently.

Container networking in EKS/ECS uses CNI plugins to manage pod IPs and communication.

Advanced networking tools like OVS, k6t, and virtual kernels are more often seen in private clouds or custom Kubernetes clusters you run on AWS EC2.

ZeroCopy techniques and enhanced networking improve performance on certain instance types.

TURN servers are needed when running real-time communications apps on AWS behind NAT/firewalls.

Libvirt is not native to AWS but common in self-hosted virtualization environments.
